[COLOR=#000080]Welcome to the application thread for the town of Volon Therys.[/COLOR]
 
[SIZE=6][COLOR=#3366ff][U][B]Description[/B][/U][/COLOR][/SIZE]
[COLOR=#000080]There are three total towns in VT control. Volon Therys is the main Elite town for experienced highly valued players. The second town, Dresden, is for people who are good players but don't quite meet Volon Therys standards. The towns are under the same rule except they have slight rule changes and different systems. The third town which is Heraklion is a town in which everyone can join which is still interlinked with Volon Therys and Dresden, so if you don't make Dresden you can always join us in Heraklion.[/COLOR]
